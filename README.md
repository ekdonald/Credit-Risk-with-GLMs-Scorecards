## Probability of Default Model Development and Validation with Generalized Linear Models

by @Donald Kpatcha

Credit risk pertains to the potential that a borrower may fail to fulfill their loan obligations, posing a substantial concern for lenders like banks
and financial institutions due to the possibility of financial losses, impacting profitability and stability. Evaluating and managing this risk is
pivotal in lending operations, involving the utilization of diverse techniques and models. Factors such as credit history, repayment capability, 
loan terms, and annual income are scrutinized to assess this risk.

Various forms of credit risk include default risk, where borrowers may not meet payment obligations, credit spread risk, which involves losses 
due to widening credit spreads, counterparty risk, concentration risk, and country risk linked to investing or lending in specific countries 
due to political or economic instability.

Credit risk assessment employs several methodologies, including credit scoring models utilizing historical data and predictive variables, 
credit rating agencies assigning credit ratings based on repayment capacity, financial statement analysis, collateral evaluation, and 
consideration of qualitative factors like management quality and industry outlook.

Many organizations, especially financial institutions, evaluate credit risk for existing and potential customers, often leveraging machine 
learning to analyze customer data for risk profiling. Machine learning aids in determining the probability of default and assessing the 
financial impact on lenders in such scenarios.

The probability of default (PD) is a fundamental metric in credit risk modeling, serving as a key indicator of the likelihood that a 
borrower will fail to meet their debt obligations. It plays a central role in assessing the risk associated with lending and investment 
decisions, influencing credit pricing, portfolio management strategies, and regulatory compliance. By quantifying the likelihood of default 
for individual borrowers or portfolios, PD enables financial institutions to make informed decisions, allocate resources effectively, 
and mitigate potential losses in their credit portfolios.
